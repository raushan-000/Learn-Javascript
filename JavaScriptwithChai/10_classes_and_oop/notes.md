# javascript and classes

## OOP

## Object

- collection of properties and methods
- toLowerCase

## why use OOP

## parts of OOP

Object literal

- Constructor function
- Prototypes
- Classes
- Instances (new, this)

## 4 pillars

Abstraction -- hiding details

Encapsulation -- hiding data

Inheritance
Polymorphism -- many form

## new keyword

- after using new keyword

1. first of all, an empty object is created wich is called as instance
2. constructor function is called because of new keyword, this function packs all argument and give
3. argument is injected inside this keyword
4. argument is passed to function

## some point

- In javascript function is function as well as object
