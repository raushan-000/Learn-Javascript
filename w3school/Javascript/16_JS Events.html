<!-- 
An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does.

Here are some examples of HTML events:

An HTML web page has finished loading
An HTML input field was changed
An HTML button was clicked
Often, when events happen, you may want to do something.

JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <style>
      #btn1 {
        background-color: brown;
      }
      #btn2 {
        background-color: yellow;
      }
      #btn3 {
        background-color: aqua;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- In this example, the JavaScript code changes the content of the element with id="demo". -->
    <button
      id="btn1"
      onclick="document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML=Date()"
    >
      The time is?
    </button>
    <p id="demo"></p>

    <!-- In this example, the code changes the content of its own element (using this.innerHTML): -->
    <button id="btn2" onclick="this.innerHTML = Date()">The time is?</button>
    <br /><br />
    <button id="btn3" onclick="displayDate()">The time is?</button>

    <p id="demo1"></p>
    <!-- JavaScript code is often several lines long. It is more common to see event attributes calling functions: -->
    <script>
      function displayDate() {
        document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = Date();
      }
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
